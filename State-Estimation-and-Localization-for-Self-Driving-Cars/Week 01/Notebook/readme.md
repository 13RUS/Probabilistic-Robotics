## Implementation the batch least squares method

You (as an intrepid electrical engineer) wish to determine the resistance of an electrical component using Ohm's law. You recall from your high school circuit classes that **V = RI**, where **V** is the voltage in volts, **R** is the resistance in ohms, and **I** is the electrical current in amperes. With data you have collected, your goals are to:

1. Fit a line through the origin (i.e., determine the parameter *a* for *y = ax*) to this data by using the method of least squares. You may assume that all measurements are of equal importance.

2. Consider what the best estimate of the resistance is, in ohms, for this component.
